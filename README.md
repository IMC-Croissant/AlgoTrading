# GROUP Croissant - IMC Prosperity Challenge

This repo has all experimental python scripts for the IMC 2023 Challenge.

## Intructions for unit test
The `unit_test.py` file executes a single timestamp locally. 
This is used for the sole purpose to check for typing errors and miscellaneous problems while testing the script.

Currently, in order to run it, is required to execute it within the `Coding/Ideas/.` folder. It takes the trader class
from `main_from_scratch.py`. Other versions can be used.

`MM_momo.py`: added order_depths, havent optimized pearls cross strategy yet, need to optimize bananas sitting at 5.8k
